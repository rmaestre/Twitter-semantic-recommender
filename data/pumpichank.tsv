@ncoghlan_dev please do!  that's great, thanks
Are you an open source/free software translator?  Please get in touch!  We need to figure out Mailman 3's translation machinery.

Happy Mailman Day!
i have a clone army.  why doesn't anyone have a clone navy?
@voidspace yeah, i try to avoid 2to3 :)
@gthank it makes it harder to support 2 &amp; 3 with one code base.  let's get to a world were we don't care about py2 anymore :)
@voidspace right, semantically i agree.  syntactically, it's just a pita (remember, i don't like 2to3 :)
carrying on 4 conversations in email, twitter, fb, irc keeps me young
@voidspace is it?  how?
@gthank so .keys() i can almost see if you really want to be explicit (i don't), but why .iterkeys()?
@dabeaz yeah, i see it all the time in code i'm porting to py3.  i don't get it
@voidspace it's almost always unnecessary and it makes porting to py3 harder.  it avoids concrete lists, but the savings is usually minimal
@flubdevork hahahah! :)
why do so many people use .iterkeys(), .iteritems(), and .itervalues() when they don't need to?  plus, they don't exist in py3
git madness #412: git add -u
oh how nice.  hey spammer, stop trying to unsub me from the mailman lists!
@pauricthelodger see the legend on this page: http://t.co/VS6qwE5f
Python 3 plans for Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzel: http://t.co/gTWShN2S
Eric Smith prototype of PEP 420.  With importlib diff is "a couple of dozen lines long".  Wow. Just wow.
selene nails it when it comes to bzr over git.  http://t.co/5cNY2K3Y
Ubuntu is committed to Upstart.  +1 http://t.co/f0u9Gvat
My suggest of Qwazy Quahog did not win (unsurprisingly :) http://t.co/f0u9Gvat
@brettsky server error
@terriko not the black kind ;)
@terriko my cousin in german makes wonderful sk and kombucha.  i tried with both but failed (due to mold). for commercial, bubbies rocks
@terriko looks delicious! but can it beat bubbies (best saurkraut ever so far :)
Okay, that was *freakin'* cool.  I saw Discovery's flyby!  Went by fast and our open sky is so small, I don't think the pictures worked
OH #ubuntu-devel: qwazy quahog makes baby jeesus qwy
just when i was running out of possibilities with my naming theme! http://t.co/aCt6MJ5X
@jkakar how right you are.  Alt is just way too overloaded.
@r1chardj0n3s welcome to the joys of the usa passenger train "service"
@jkakar ug, single worst pain i'm experiencing these days.  hope it becomes configurable before final release!
@petrillic friend of mine saw that show too and loved it.  #screenkissbassline
soon, very soon...
@petrillic of course!  time to start on python 4
new python docs theme?  yeah, no possibility of bikeshedding on that
@voidspace oh sigh #pep417 of course!
@voidspace i am so hearting mock right now #pep407
@pumpichank make that @florianfuchs :)
@pumpichank have to thank @florian_fuchs for that one.
@dougnap thanks for all your truly awesome work in making pycon 2012 the best evar.
"Postorius" is the new name for the Mailman 3 web ui.  Who can spot the reference? :)
#pycon #mailman3 sprint going great!  todo list growing :)
@terriko Uh oh.  I hope I didn't break Py2.6 support.  I only want to do that when we switch to #python3 :)
@petrillic Keep them as proof for when the RIAA police break down your front door.
#mailman3 sprinters #pycon: i'll probably be down in the room by 9:30, but we won't start officially until 10am tomorrow.
best #pycon ever... over!  let the sprints begin.  mailman3 sprint starts monday at 10am local time.
@carljm unfortunately no
Killer py3 app. Django 1.5 in the fall supporting up to py 3.3
@ncoghlan_dev almost. Neither cheese shop has *cheese*. &lt;wink&gt;
@carljm georg is 3.3 rm
@ncoghlan_dev Let The Googles do its thing for finding the catalog of Python packages.  Cute is not always bad!
@ncoghlan_dev OTOH it's just a name.  CPAN means nothing so there's zero intuitive connection from Perl Package -&gt; CPAN.
@ncoghlan_dev Really?  Why?
#pycon don't forget you *lose* an hour of sleep tonight at 2am.  #dst begins
@ncoghlan_dev I'm on a mission to resurrect the Cheeseshop name.  As predicted, it's impossible to distinguish the homonyms.
http://t.co/vSmYMikc #pycon YAY!  but can we all please go back to Cheeseshop instead of PyPI?
#python saw @marksapiro and @florianfuchs.  Gaining critical mass for upcoming Mailman 3 sprint.
@r1chardj0n3s Freaking awesome.  Wanna jam on a Python theme song? :)
#pycon at the web summit.  interesting discussions about packaging.  py3 (which i'm moderating) is up in 30m
@jessenoller @pydanny @dabeaz yes, but *much* more friendly to dietary restrictions.
@jessenoller @pydanny @dabeaz I appreciate the difficulty w/catering, but are buffets (with ingredient lists) at all possible?
OH #pycon @gvanrossum ""after 20 years we've finally found a use-case for freeze"
OH #pycon @gvanrossum "most people don't know where the language ends and the library begins"
If any locals coming to #pycon can pick up a bottle of low sodium Tamari, I would buy you a beer while we eat sushi together :)
@voidspace default python will probably stay sync'd with debian (i.e. 2.7) but we'll hash that bit out at UDS in May.
Python 3 only on the Ubuntu 12.10 CD (that's the release after this LTS).  Port, port, port!
Getting close?  I think so!
@brettsky my drummer has the tdi wagon and loves it.  we've had a '99 passat and it's still (mostly) working.  nice cars :)
@voidspace i think that's just a polite way of saying "some old f*ck"
This looks very cool.  Easy setup of your mail accounts: http://t.co/4UZafzKv  and open source too.
I am famous now: http://t.co/SVPEB8dB
@nedbat all we really need is  ur'hi'
so, python 3.3 is going to put the 'u' back in 'unicode'.
@jessenoller	you rock!
python release candidates fixing hash security issue coming rsn for all stable releases.  we'll need testers!
i think we may actually see release candidates for python's hash randomization fixes rsn http://t.co/oJPsiq8S
@jessenoller i have lots of original music i could probably get you at least a cc type license for.  email me?
if your first email to me is full of curses and insults, don't be surprised if you never get a response, even if i could have been helpful
oh, i am *really* liking the new blue indicator color scheme
"extreme experience i've had as a programmer"?  maybe that time i helped tom cruise hack into the nuclear diamond farm in fort knox...
@dohbee finding that reliable betamax player is the problem :)
@petrillic awesome, thanks for the pointer
does anybody know of a reliable service or product to convert a betamax tape into a dvd?
5 minute guide to getting the Mailman 3 web ui running: http://t.co/Knl44Fqk
#pycon2012 is shaping up to be so amazingly awesome, but i really need to finish my clone army in time so "i" can see everything
@voidspace i can't decide if that's  an oxymoron or a tautology
thanks to everyone in ubuntu for my election to the developer membership board!
So our galaxy is "humming with myterious microwaves"?  It's clear someone wants to eat us like popcorn.  Did you hear that ding too?
@tpherndon let's be sure to meet up at #pycon and do some pushing.  we can start easy. :)
@ncoghlan_dev yeah, i'm still not a fan of pep 410 as written #python-dev
@dougnap that will probably be perfect, as long as they're not locked at 6am :)
you should blow your child's mind at least once a day
@tpherndon nice.  i did yang long *years* ago. been doing yang short for about 10 years (plus push hands and sword form). do you push?
Vote for your favorite questions @ Pycon web summit: http://t.co/vnDGvtq4
@voidspace yeah. it's a great time but as a semi-pro musician, i definitely understand.  otoh, tai chi is best on 1hr of sleep :)
@jessenoller any chance we can get access to an empty-ish room in the mornings for taichi/yoga?  and can i sign up for 6am taichi slot?
this comment makes me sad: http://t.co/Pw8TABpq
@voidspace really?  wow. i love my msnk.  plus it's cheap :)
Why do gmail replies always look so horrible in every other mail reader?
Kind of scary that in 7 months, I've deleted nearly 100k email messages.  I'm thinking I need to empty my trash folder.
pycon 2012 capped at 1500 attendees, and almost sold out?!

Happy 2112 day all you Rush fans! http://t.co/6bA2X4RD (and happy Mailman day too)
Happy birthday Guido van Rossum!
@pumpichank make that C-= in rst-mode
Just discovered M-+ in Emacs's rst-mode.  Wow!
@alex_gaynor that makes me sad! ;)
@jessenoller \o/
@jessenoller why is there no link from the pycon 2012 front page to the sprints page?
Three new tunes uploaded to http://t.co/Y9n3c9kH
I just heard from another Mailman core dev attending Pycon and sprinting on Mailman 3.  You should join us!   http://t.co/B5ZnRGVO
Me: "it's gonna be coooool!" Max: "it's gonna suck"
dbus-python 1.0.0 released upstream with my python 3 changes: http://t.co/srpRTnTz  now to see about packaging that for debuntu
Yay!  Looks like I made it through the Precise X transition with my desktop intact.
Another reason to love Showtime's "Shameless": the theme song rocks, especially the bass line: http://t.co/uHPItnDb
@jorendorff but we didn't use dicts to implement it. :)  dict ordering has been undefined for *forever* :)
@jorendorff when we designed the dict-like api for email.Message objects, we explicitly documented order is preserved.
Yes, we know that http://t.co/7AR4or8g is down.  No ETA yet on when it will be back up.
pypy users: 1.7+dfsg-5 is now available in my PPA: http://t.co/PQltZQh4  please test it.  Let's get PyPy into Ubuntu 12.04!
Hey Pythonistas: you know you cannot rely on dictionary order, right?
max and i want to know: what is *your* burpword?
New article on Debian packaging for Python 2 and Python 3: http://t.co/VxFmHvXE
feedparser 5.1-0ubuntu2 uploaded, now with freshly homemade python 3 support
Hey Python 3 porters, thanks to Colin Watson, "six" is now in Precise: http://t.co/XDF8gGSe
feedparser's test suite seems, um success challenged
@jessenoller "protects consumers" hahahahahahahahahahahahahah
@terriko i never had the chance to meet him, but he was always so nice in email, and a great contributor.  very sad.
@maco_nix it does indeed :/
Today's lesson: do not type `shutdown -h now` accidentally in a root schroot.
Sad news: highly influential Japanese open source dev and Mailman contributor Tokio Kikuchi has passed away: http://t.co/HMv4iB5g
Hey #udd Ubuntu developers.  When the new bzr and bzr-bd lands in Precise, you will love it.  Sane merges w/quilt patches!
Python 3 porting redux: http://t.co/TOuUlPGm  Now heading to Budapest for more porting and other stuff w/my Ubuntu engineering colleagues.
New dbus-python w/python3 support uploaded to PPA: http://t.co/PQltZQh4 (may take a while to build).  Please double check!
#rcn just did a big swap of our #tivo gear.  I now have a TiVo-quad plus two satellites.  More disk and tuners, better u/i... and cheaper!
You are awesome, Tracy Morgan
@freddrake it's not actually crazy though.  i'd love for packaging to fail if there are unit test failures.  we try to do this in debian
it seems impossible to support `python setup.py test` and `python -m unittest discover` so all tests get run exactly once :(
time for my annual "remind me how to generate new self-signed certificates" connundrum
sbuild users: when you upgrade to precise, if you were using aufs, switch to overlayfs.  the former is gone.
yay.  more python 3 bytes/str porting madness.  this time, email headers/addrs, re, etc.  stay tuned for blog post redux
@voidspace be sure to open source the code :)
1-for-3 #pycon talks accepted, which is fantastic, and about what i expected.  #mailman3 was the lucky winner.
@ncoghlan_dev it does appear to ;)
progress made on dbus-python test suite failures: http://t.co/skIoiqqn
@jgderose: nothing yet on lpbug 905085.  i'm keeping a browser window open on it though!
oh, and give that derived class some methods and a docstring
here's some fun: define a class that derives from two classes with different metaclasses, and make it work in py2 and py3
Vanessa at Amazon, you did a beautiful, kind thing for my son tonight.  Thank you where ever you are.
@jgderose Off hand, I don't know, but I'll look into this tomorrow. Hopefully we can make it work!
@petrillic The terrorists have already won.  Talk about asymmetric warfare.  Sit back and watch us destroy our own principles. Cost: $0
Final gear question of the season: iPhone4S.  Verizon, ATT, or Sprint?
@maco_nix i've been an independent since 2008.  i'll look at 3rd parties for 2012. i really wish we had viable options. :(
The Dems must love spelunking 'cause they're so good at caving.

@akuchling thanks andrew.  the online git docos are pretty good.  i think i get it, but that doesn't mean i like it :)
@voidspace it's *only* so upstream will have an easier time with the patches (some already applied!).  git, like hg, is so brain-hurty
