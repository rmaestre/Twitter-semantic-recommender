@ericflo not trolling.. the inbox code is based on the stdlib smtp module, which is based on asyncore already.
@kennethreitz eventlet?  is this just not like.. asyncore?
@kennethreitz why bother making people compile the c extensions to gevent just to diddle select()?
every time i use a framework or library i wrote i close my eyes and pray that the old me was smarter than the new me
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes that intersection of tech (logging + django) is all about the globals i think, for better or worse
@brandon_rhodes cloudmacs?
@philikon i'm too big of a douchebag for a blameless twitter audience to get the full assault, i suspect
it makes for a more pleasant environment when irc channels disallow cursing..  but where else am i supposed to vent?
@garybernhardt http://t.co/44QgukO7 may help
@ncoghlan_dev yeah those make sense and are definitely convenient
@ncoghlan_dev looking at pulpdist a bit.. does it offer up an API that is meant to be subclassed?  it doesnt appear so.
@ncoghlan_dev do you mean the stuff in _abcoll.py?
@zzzeek nah.. but the dude makes more arguments for sane composition (e.g. forms not tied to models) than he does for language features
@ncoghlan_dev is there a particularly well-designed subclassing api you'd recommend looking at?
@zzzeek that original article struck me as not so much an argument for haskell as for decomposed frameworks
@zzzeek say this after hearing a norwegian say "we" about his legal system.. can't remember the last time i said "we" about anything USA
the job of a politician should be to maximize the number of people who he includes when he says "we"
@brandon_rhodes ha, not so subtly sent that along to maybe get your thoughts ;-)
@brandon_rhodes i think "codependency" is a reasonable term (at least that's what i'm using in https://t.co/oGTNEgxa )
@brandon_rhodes ... but but brandon.. but..... &lt;okay&gt;
is there a name for the antipattern where you're encouraged to subclass from a class that has overrideable methods which call each other?
@whitmo @brandon_rhodes not more more sane recently, i'm just not dissatisfied with any version.. more dissatisfied with the alternatives
@diana_clarke i approve
@palendae not sure they "use eggs" as much as we tell people to use easy_install, which creates eggs at install time
@kstrauser nope, apparently we're supposed to ship everything with everything else
@kstrauser yup... distutils, setuptools/distribute
sucks so hard to be scorned by users for making use of existing crap python packaging tools.. but at least we have a monotonic clock pep!
@whitmo meanwhile us old farts keep making software
@mtrier i think i got mine on fred fish disks
@palendae nice.. i've got a soft spot in my heart for them
fucking slackware.  with 20 floppies.  uphill.  both ways.  you fucking whiners.
#ubuntu+1 irc channel people are nice even to people who really should eat shit and die
i will blame greg ward (of distutils) for my eventual RSI from having to FUCKING CHANGE DIRECTORIES TO RUN SETUP.PY
@nerdworldorder @niallohiggins recently got set up on dotcloud with satisfactory result.  @benbangert seems to like heroku.  no default.
@nerdworldorder my own servers
@nerdworldorder i never used ep.io, so not really sure, but http://t.co/JQVvsnYt has instructions for heroku, dotcloud, openshift
used @shiningpandaci  today to get jenkins-based windows test automation, it works well!
@shiningpandaci hi, i just signed up as a FOSS project and bought some creits but I can't use them until unqueued?
when you're working so hard you forget to pay attention to competition and later, when you do, you sort of pity them a little?  yeah, that.

every time i think i find a bug in deform_boostrap, once i dig into it,  @dnouri has already figured it out and it's my own fault..
holy endless monotonic clock thread
@codeinpy quote on site page explains it :)
@faassen the "retail" portion would just be a normal pyramid app that happens to use the objects visible via the management ui

i agree and disagree so hard: http://t.co/CehJ8eca
@dnouri is it a joke or for real?  i'll never tell...
@diana_clarke lol wtf ... although that's a cool idea ;-)
@brandon_rhodes "fixed testing, and added some more testing. Still some tests to fix."!
@zzzeek i have a style of taking both fingers from under the desk and sneaking up on my monitor in a swooping motion
@junkafarian dunno if it's comparable but https://t.co/PATlYOJq
@brandon_rhodes they are mostly hilarious too, although i was talking about some young Cato Institute speaker on c-span in particular
things that are hilarious: people who are still mad at FDR
every system you create makes total sense until you need to document it, at which point you ask yourself "what madman wrote this?"
@lmacken nice hi hat accents ;-)
buildout is disgusting: "We have the best distribution that satisfies 'nose'.  Picked: nose = 1.1.2"
@chriswithers13 you've been replaced
is there a word for a troll whom you actually know and interact with regularly?  if not i think we need a new word.
@brandon_rhodes true dat.. ok i'm solidly back in the "get off my lawn" camp then wrt trailing whitespace
@diana_clarke oh sure laugh at my pain
@brandon_rhodes ah ok.. that'd be cool though wouldnt it..
@brandon_rhodes i know when you say "my editor" you mean emacs.. what magic do you use to strip trailing ws from edited lines?
"I really want to do the job that the OS already does for me!" == anyone who writes a web 1.0 app using async code
@cmr1975 much much worse
@tomlazar @dnouri that'd be fine by me... i have no particular love for the default look and feel
@dnouri is my hero this week for deform_bootstrap
OK, responses confirm that trailing whitespace cleanup is a circlejerk.
an unholy task now has me in its grip
can somebody tell me why anyone should actually give a shit about cleaning up trailing whitespace in python
I just found out that Brian Lamb is retiring from @cspan .  What a hero he is.  Thank you for your service, Mr. Lamb!
@ianbicking good to hear it went as well as it did, i know it must have been hard on everyone
@jacobian care to share a link?
lol people who think dropping a "beta" designation comes along with an improvement in stability
@freddrake you should subscribe to @NewsInTheBurg for twitter traffic clusterfuck updates
nose.. lots of option flags... never the one i need.
@benbangert 917
@diana_clarke never any shortage of stuff to do and you can ping me any time on irc or here, it's a pleasure
@diana_clarke not to steal you away from @zzzeek but if you're looking to do more testing work, pyramid_debugtoolbar == shitty coverage
py25,py26,py27,py32,pypy,jython .. worst. game. of. twister. ever.
some arguments that folks can't use flexible systems and plug together components == "why can't i hold all these limes??"
@niallohiggins don't worry, no matter what verb you use, an enthusiastic 19 year old will soon explain to you why you're wrong
@ncoghlan_dev oh come on guido's not that bad... ;-)
funniest OH at pycon sprints... &lt;someone&gt;: "where are the zope people?" @ubernostrum:  "dunno, probably under a pile of interfaces"
@seedifferently heh i reshared a post on g+ ;-)

@diana_clarke does awesome work on #pyramid #pylons
going to @cguardia's pyramid talk at #pycon
@andreypopp see you tonite.. btw, try to get an invite to the pyladies/surveymonkey party (ask at pyladies booth)
@andreypopp I'll be at party tonite then bar

@wwitzel3 can't hang but c u tmrw
@wwitzel3 almost certainly we'll be at bar
@blaiselaflamme @cguardia I'm staying in to write presentation
On Hyatt bar patio
@blaiselaflamme in Tuscan restaurant at Hyatt now
@ncoghlan_dev codepoints eh
@jessenoller @brian_curtin yup they're all there for python 3 of course ;-)
@brian_curtin @jessenoller it's tempting to make fun of the wild overestimates, but i think it's a mistake to dismiss the sentiment
@zzzeek ok, its just that the attributeerror in that output looks suspicious
@zzzeek https://t.co/iy9dH3mY .. you might try something like this (to make sure autodoc has access to built code)
@zzzeek have you pinged ericholscher on irc?  he's pretty helpful.
@Fear_Factory does the concept of the industrialist relate in any way to ayn rand?  (e.g. http://t.co/UMQ2h71D)

@jessenoller guidebook data is awesome
@whitmo @kennethreitz yep that sign screams virginia alright...
is anyone willing to act as the official "scribe" of the #pycon web summit?  e.g. capture a publishable summary.
@palendae we *might* be able to make the audio available; but even if not, no harm in asking questions and getting answers 2nd hand
There's still a few days left to submit questions for the PyWeb summit panelists at #pycon http://t.co/Pvqo5p7k
@wolever strings have __iter__ in py3
@iamnotcasey ewwww
this works-under-py2 code: "if not hasattr(permissions, '__iter__'): permissions = [permissions]" almost ruined my python security under py3
@dougzor thank you!  i am but the messenger, might you mail pyramid@webhippo.net to work out details?

my town's "police tips" site: http://166.61.195.119/p2c/  that's right.. no domain name.. creepy javascript alerts on entry.  comforting.
oh random internet guy, you have a very important question.  i know this because you've added lots of question marks to it.
if not, i think i may call it mcdonough's law
is there some sort of "x's law" name for the phenomenon "if you actually do something, someone else will eventually complain about it"
@mitsuhiko how do you mean?  what breaks?
@fijall greeeeeat
a friend wants to get into #pycon, is there any mechanism for him to pay a premium or otherwise prostrate himself to get in?
@kisielk yep, thanks.. the chipin wsiwyg editor is a horror so it's likely to remain broken (i've tried to fix it about six times)
@btbytes thank you
@seedifferently well, at least you can now just say "please submit a pull request"
