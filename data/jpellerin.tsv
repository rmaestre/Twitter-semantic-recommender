Did you know that nose has user and developer groups, and an issue tracker? It's true.
Tor/Forge E-book Titles to Go DRM-Free http://t.co/mfLaz8qe ... good news and the only way to prevent an all-amazon future for books.
Here is a cool thing we made at work. http://t.co/UBvnxaJf
@kscottz One pattern for adding flags is have plugin set things in module. Example: https://t.co/XRiAnwtB / But ENV is easier 4 1 flag
@kscottz Env variable? DUMP_IMAGES=1 nosetests ... But I don't know how decorators are involved so I'm prbly missing something.
nose2 docs are now on readthedocs. http://t.co/kDhw8YgM
@kscottz @ehofer Really! My brain is mostly full of toddlers these days but still may be pickable.
It's snowing.
Better link for that last one: http://t.co/CvduMG1i
Speaking of nose2, perhaps you'd like to use it with django? http://t.co/gmtmHVko
nose2 0.3 is out. New plugins, new features, and fewer bugs. http://t.co/dlI5aize. Slogan: "Now it might be usable!"
Watching http://t.co/A1O3sCTz while I delete 12000 error emails, 50 at a time.
@catechism I never leave the house and I'm really cold right now.
Pączki from Zingerman's. Good.
nose2 0.2 is out. Now an alpha release and possibly safe for small, friendly robots. http://t.co/Z9TRNimK
The Wise Man's Fear radically changed my opinion of The Name of the Wind (for the better).
@nedbat eventually unittest2 and nose2 will agree... but not for a while yet. :(
@club_is_open Awesome! Welcome home Mr. O!
@club_is_open woo! Congratulations!
@zeeg I'd probably use a custom loader or suite class, but runner.run() should work as well as long as you don't mind losing lazy loading.
@zeeg reorder within a module, a few ways. Reorder all tests across modules, not really -- lazy loading gets in the way.
@bitprophet: Oh! Yeah, that was the other Niven/Pournelle book. Nevermind, NPR voters. Carry on.
Lucifer's Hammer? The thing about the space elephants? One of the best 100 SF books ever? Really, NPR voters. Really.
@jessenoller @asksol @kumar303 Minimum nose version for 2.7 compat is 0.11.4. pypi had that hidden but I just unhid it.
@zeeg: Sure, I can see that being useful. nose core has a pretty long release cycle, though.
@zeeg: A plugin to allow test collection only from unittest.TestCases?
By the way, nose 1.1 was released today, thanks to the efforts of @kumar303 and many patches.
@bitprophet: Just a mistake, should be all fixed now.
@jessenoller @zeeg unhid nose 1.0 from pypi, better now?
@jessenoller Welcome! As world's worst meditator, I can say, it helps.
@jessenoller @dnoller You're most welcome.
@dnoller: ... knowing (a little) how tough it is to have a sick baby. We're all thinking of you and hoping for the best.
@dnoller: My daughter will be really happy to hear that Abby is happy (esp. about the car, she insisted on that). Glad to help a little...
♺ @club_is_open: @jessenoller Thoughts to you and @dnoller. // Likewise.
Feast for Crows was much better on re-read. One week to DwD-dammerung!
@jessenoller Happy birthday Abby!
@LizBraswell: Awesome!
@club_is_open Congratulations!
