If short on time, skip to solo by Dave Gilmore (not from Pink Floyd), 7:30. Sick! That's how its done:  http://t.co/dBdHJ6zR
The music in this next vid solves both those problems! Steve Coleman &amp; 5 elements, live 1990. Insane!  Long vid but worth it.
There is some "shred" music I don't like b/c its not interactive. Some "prog" I don't like b/c it's too "white." However...
Next Thurs: 'Standards 4 A New Generation' Master Class w AS Trio at The Collective School Of Music NYC: http://t.co/ugTIZI5e
Reminder: jazzy stuff coming up in NYC. On Sat. I'll play w Randy Klein's  'Two Duos' w acoustic piano http://t.co/UrQtHhfE
About 2 yrs (14-16). But it took yrs to sink in “@metalmoog: @robraymond69 How many years did u take lessons with Satch Alex?”
Never ran into KH there, but I'd see Larry from Primus “@milkobabalu: true that u &amp; Kirk Hammet were students of Satriani at the same time?”
Love 'em &amp; have learned a few licks c“@ColourfulNative: What do u think of guys like Merle Travis, Chet Atkins, &amp; Jerry Reed?”
In my teens, studying w local teacher (named Joe Satriani)  “@RobRaymond69:  when did u learn your theory side of music????”
Tabs are often wrong, better to learn by ear. Notation is good 4 charts.  “@StanSher:  @metalmoog but what about guitar tabs?”
Not everyday. But it depends where I am. At shows, often. “@kirkskydive: how often do you typically get rocognized?”
Ha ha. Probably a million jokes that could start with "So if Brooklyn Bans Boobs..."
Good points “@VoiceOfTheSoul: So if Brooklyn bans boobs, what r they going 2 do about the naked Monroe on the front page of @NYDailyNews?
“@OtimMichael: @AlexSkolnick &gt; If Brooklyn bans boobs, then why are they building a new arena for the Nets to move there next season?
And here it is, today's @NYDailyNews front page headline. Hey @NYTimes, top this! (pun intended) ;) http://t.co/G3Dg7lqi
So easy to tweet by accident while trying to correct!  Grrrr. Let's try that again...
And here it is, today's front page @NYDailyNews front page headline. Hey @NYTimes, top this! (pun intended) ;) http://t.co/LRDxOhNW
Wonder who comes up w these front page headlines for NY Daily News? Looks fun! Good one from last week: http://t.co/JBuOZMJ0
Got recognized in my neighborhood today w hair tied, yoga mat on back &amp; a shot of wheatgrass in hand. #SoMuch4MetalImage
No. But helpful 4 learning tunes. “@metalmoog: Alex, is the ability to read music notation essential to understanding theory?"
It can be tough. A great solo should not be sloppy, yet never too perfect, otherwise it loses the 'magic'   @dj_mark33
Yes. Studio = Microscope. Noises, pitch, timing issues all enhanced. “@dj_mark33: Alex, is the solo the hardest part to track?
MasterClass May 10 http://t.co/ugTIZI5e “@DOUGLASPRATES: when is  going to be your next time playing in NYC? Any chance for may?? ”
Not complaining, but musicians' schedules can be tough at times. Thinks its easy? U need 2 tag along on days like this!
Beatles reference aside...overnight flight, cab home, couple hrs nap, now back in the studio 2 record last minute solo parts
Flew from Santiago up 2 NYC, didn't get 2 bed last night. Malcolm Gladwell paperback was on my knee, man it was a long ass flight
Many runners/cyclists out. Felt like Central Park transported 2 Latin America. One cyclist even recognized me, hair tied etc..
And u see that mountian? This morning, I ran that thing- 7 miles! Amazing, panoramic views. Wish I had camera up there.
It's a beautiful, sunny Sunday in Santiago. Shame 2 have 2 leave, but at least we got a break from rain http://t.co/PhPxVYCq
Prepping to leave the great land of Chile 4 home. Short &amp; sweet. Agreed, should've been more gigs on this trip (not my call).
Here's a pic during @Anthrax: Sick crowd (w/ that rubber chicken from yesterday watching over things) http://t.co/GnbaDf1d
Gracias, Santiago! With respect 2 US audiences, wishing we could bring everyone on a field trip down here 2 see how its done!

The subject of 'God' is individual, subjective &amp; based on logic, feeling &amp; personal experiences. On that note, goodnight!
..nobody knows for sure. So you can't impose your belief system (organized religion or otherwise) on anyone else.
I hesitate to give a label, 'God' or otherwise to him/her/it or whatever, if it even exists. That's my choice. But the fact is
Re: my own belief system - I'm open to the idea that there may be certain forces beyond our comprehension. Or not...
'My God doesn't judge people over something as RIDICULOUS as not believing in God.' Well said. Read the thread by @lambvox

Chile-Night b4 show soundcheck, view from monitor desk: Drums? Check. Amps? Check. Rubber chicken? Check http://t.co/aPHx5vgd
Powering down again, time to fly all night (9.5 hrs).  Chile here we come...
Hmm. Now who in that camp would possibly be thinking of it? ;) “@MaccaF1Gooner: Uh oh. U made me think of Ozzy &amp; Randy Rhoads"
True &amp; cool, updated music was played around it @Papa_Cass was just a video of Frank, not fake holograms saying he was there.
Zappa Plays Zappa is 1 thing, family affair.  But not sure what Cliff, Dime &amp; others would think if they were 'brought back'
An exception: @DweezilZappa does an amazing show interacting w his dad, the late great Frank Zappa. Saw it in late '10.
Anytime u put together a show or recording with a deceased artist, u have to be careful. You don't know this person's wishes.
The fact that it's been pulled off for hip-hop means it's prob a matter of time before it carries over to metal &amp; other styles
Not about musical styles. I'm an admirer of Dre, who's behind it, but unsure about the concept &amp; it's long term implications
Cool to get a different perspective. “@Jam_Stoker: ...not to mention it is a really cool technology with a ton of potential!”
Could be “@ASpenillo:  @mongolvsheriff I'm sure that the Hendrix and Cobain estates are already talking to their lawyers”
Layover in ATL. While in the air, lots of responses to last few tweets re: Tupac's (literal) resurrection..
Have to power down now. If this plane crashes, please don't tour me as a hologram. Thank you.
I shudder to think some of the tours that may be in the works by artists no longer with us, put on by their estate handlers...
Is this what popular music has become? So lacking in new ideas that its more exciting to resurrect deceased artists?
Initial thoughts on the Tupac hologram thing: a creepy sign of our times.  @Mongolvsheriff
Wondered that as well. Who makes the $$? “@Mongolvsheriff:  Bands tour w holograms of dead members. Do dead people get check?”
No prob. Glad ur open 2 it. “@DraugUlfr: Thxs 4 this blogpost. Just getting started myself & this is the kind of stuff I need to hear now!”
Before I leave, thx 4 the positive comments re: new blog post on music spamming. Once again:  http://t.co/o3dvFjH0
SFO  About to fly 2 Atlanta, arriving early evening, then layover & overnight flt 2 Santiago. Arriving early tmrw morning.
New blog post: 'Le Juge II (Deax) La Sollicitation' http://t.co/o3dvFjH0
This subject is discussed in greater detail on my site. Aspiring musicians are encouraged to read it...
A while ago, I went on a rant re: those who post their music on others' Twitter/FB pages (unsolicited flyers, links, etc..)
Today, recorded solo 4 last of the DROE bonus tunes (a remake of one of our classic title trax). Running thru live set soon..
Like a gig & lecture. U can but don't have 2 “@ShinboneStarr: how does a Masterclass actually work? Do you bring your guitar?”
yes “@ChrisLaplante72:  hope u kept yours !“@Ibanez_USA RE: your Maxxas. There were 112pcs in 1987 & 344 in 1988, world wide””
In the meantime, made it into @nytimes  for Moscot glasses metal ad campaign http://t.co/ILXpsluH. (Great pic of @Scott_Ian)
Flew 2 West Coast, scant sleep, hope 2 catch up 2nite. Quick rehearsal in a bit, hitting it hard tomorrow, then fly 2 Chile.

The Collective NYC, presents: @AlexSkolnick Trio 'Standards 4 A New Generation' Master Class. May 10 7pm  http://t.co/ugTIZI5e
Been a wild ten days or so. Multiple sessions, Montreal, Radio City et al.  Today: packing & errands. This wk fly to Chile...
Thx! It was an honor. @RadioCity Ha ha! Pleasure 2 have u on the great stage. RT @AlexSkolnick: This dive again? (sigh)
Thx, looking 4ward! “@toneconcepts: and more JAM Pedals to come ;-) nice chatting last week. Will send you a note tomorrow - Seraphim”
It is - bonus tracks & B sides. See earlier tweets. “@cremacafe_steve:  Doesn't sound like it's a @testamentband album then.”
Great tone for today's sessions. Had help from a secret weapon (courtesy @jampedals) http://t.co/U6YYJifo
Done tracking! Had a blast channeling the power of these animalistic cover tunes (a couple hints right there). ;)
Loaded up on brunch, coffee (& just a few sips of mimosa). Now it's time 2 get  2 work! Hello studio... http://t.co/Q46bGR4Y
It rocked! “@RichieWilsonNYC: Excited 4 an amazing brunch w @RachelFineMusic @cwotd @KristinChristy & @AlexSkolnick in LIC.”
Aughfghghghhhhhhhhh. Lol “@dandyxands:  so June right?”
Off 2 bed. Must rest up 4 tracking, preceeded by brunch w some cool friends. No more hints folks. July, July, July! Gnite ;)
July. July. July. Did I mention it'll be released in July?  “@DanielFar_lml:  Dark Roots will be released in May???”
good call “@gargreguan:  @threejawchuck Far be it for me to argue. But I'd also suggest "Goodbye 2 Romance" - perhaps an easier transition.”
'Dark Roots' = "Dark Roots Of Earth" = Next Testament album. July release date (final)  @janl78 @ianchurch75
Great bonus trax too. Can't say exactly what covers. But 1 of the bands may have had a member on @ThatMetalShow tonight. ;)
BTW, going into studio tomorrow 2 record solos for bonus cover tracks 2b incl w 'Dark Roots' CD. Actual album
trax r mixed.
July (4 real this time). “@sfennell99: When is the new Testament album coming out? Can't wait.”
Hope 2 go..& run steps a la Rocky ;) “@DebWNJ: As I see u r a fan of art, have u seen VanGogh &/or photog @zo estrauss @philamuseum of art?”
“@threejawchuck: for all your metal fans who want 2 branch out, where should I start if I want 2 sample your jazz side?” New album 'Veritas'
Re: last Tweet. Thx 4 all the comments & RT's! Looks like there's room 4 a little bit of depth in Twitter/FB land (who knew?)
"Here's a universal truth: People, like music, are too complex to be labeled or put into neat little boxes."  AS
From the liner notes:
 VERITAS   '[Eng. VE-ri-tas - noun]  Latin: TRUTH.'
Current AST Album = 'Veritas' http://t.co/IryhKgtB  http://t.co/XiYFzzUf
As one fan posted (thx whoever you are) "I hesitate to compare them to the mundane sounds that most ears would relate to."
4 those who don't know): 'Last Day In Paradise' = '07 @alexskolnick trio album  http://t.co/GrSh9aT2
What a night at Radio City! Thx 2 the fantastic @rodgab 4 inviting me. And the C.U.B.A. guys=sick band. C their show if u can!
This dive again? (sigh) http://t.co/kt5XiCpA
Looking forward to a very cool show tonight (w guest appearance by yours truly): http://t.co/KYk91oNn
Show is sold out, btw. No tix left :(
Wait 'till u hear what we have worked up! Hopefully someone will film...
Tomorrow night (Fri 4/20), I'll be sitting in w @rodgab and C.U.B.A. at Radio City Music Hall!
Was saving this as a surprise but too psyched after great rehearsal 2day for an upcoming guest appearance (some will guess)...

Colbert Report last night = brilliant material, 1st class comedy. Worth the cost of this month's cable bill. 
@StephenAtHome
On a brighter note (sort of)... Lemmy will outlive us all!  http://t.co/FrJmjeLT
Sorry 2 hear of Levon Helm tonight. Not the most household of names, but you've heard that voice, whether you know it or not.
So many losses in music world so far this year (and outside too)  http://t.co/975oKfAF  #LifeIsShort folks...
@Scott_Ian So true. People who give up on the music they love (not to mention their individuality), seem to age much faster.
New blog post re: my experience judging bands in Montreal -  
 'Le Juge (The Judge)'  http://t.co/Y5Z8G7ax
Caught it close to 4pm in NYC, on the rebroadcast. Great radio! “@EddieTrunk: You can hear me on @HowardStern show...During Robin's News
Back in the US, catching up on news: @CNN interviews a dude who tried out 4 the Denver Broncos Cheerleaders #SlowNewsWeek?
More on this later. Gonna take a few days & enjoy the awesomeness that is the city of Montreal...
Some ok bands, but so much emphasis on image. Bodypaint, executioner hoods, swords...live snakes?!!  Really?  (Yes, really).
Great time last night judging bands competing 4 a slot on the Heavy MTL fest (w System, Manson, LOG, many more)
It was the main medium & much better “@Jct2b: Love the old vinyl. They don't make the analog like they used to, great raw sound 4 the bands”
"Deuce." We got a bit carried away... @JasonRockmanSod @Chom977 http://t.co/S0jhuND9
Man, orig. Kiss sounds so good on Vinyl..Ok about to go live on @Chom977 as the Stones' 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' plays. Feels like the 70's...
Both. Solo gtr soundscapes w literature & drama “@Eli_Sheppard:  Radically different from what? Testament or AST?” http://t.co/YXHdBLoe

Had early am flight, JFK to Montreal (after 2 days recording radically different music). Resting up 2 be a judge tomorrow...
Still in trance from Anoushka Shankar concert last night. Nice 2 b reminded that music, when done w purpose, has that effect.
Incredible concert by Anoushka Shankar 2nite. Highly virtuosic & deeply hypnotic. Oh & she's beautiful.  http://t.co/1P4VskwE
Eight is enough “@steviesnacks: all I see is lots of empty floor space that could hold more pedals.”
So so wrong!  (But admittedly funny)  @realgilbert
" @RealGilbert: Mike Wallace would have still been alive if they called the ambulance 60 Minutes earlier.  R.I.P. Mike Wallace
So wrong “@RealGilbert: It would have been funny if Mike Wallace died of a TICK TICK TICK bite. Seriously R.I.P. Mike Wallace”
That's on the ADA Flange “@MattPaneth: "Alex is a Skolnick." Which pedal was that? I forget.”
"Alex is a jazzer"  That's from @rodgab's monitor guy, Mike. (Irish humor) “@leadpipefl68: What does your Line 6 pedal say?
In a couple hrs, going to hear the sitar of Anoushka Shankar (daughter of Ravi & sister of Nora Jones). Incredible musician
Also lots of pedals. http://t.co/6QmTYNyt

My first #FF @lambvox @stringjuggler  @AnthonyBozza1 @TheRealOderus @NetReynolds @TheResident @EricaJong @ned_vizzini @GuyKawasaki @Lefsetz
Today, I've written about some really good (and underappreciated) music. Check out my 'Big Band Blog:' http://t.co/DQhGYRKw
After yesterday's Tweets, I made a 'pledge to self' 'to not rant about bad music!.' At least for a day. ;0  In fact...
@stringjuggler @vortmax29 Billy minus Billy? Thats got to be weird if your own band members start a tribute band  http://t.co/jEkJoOta
Saw it 2. Eau de jock strap? Locker room? Pine tar? @monkeyminder @ajjacobs : saw subway ad 4 "NY Yankees Fragrance." http://t.co/mZ83GU1m
I'm hearing Summer. Don't quote me “@themambalamps:  safe to assume Dark Roots of Earth isn't coming out this month anymore?”
@barenschield Nice. I actually have met cool jocks & fratboys - they exist. But at UCBerkeley, when  I was growing up, they were the worst!
With a '7/4! breakdown!' Great live clip: http://t.co/n7cgscUl @stringjuggler @vortmax29  "Jive Talking" is a *fantastic* track. So hot!
I like some grunge bands, but not what the movement became. Apparently, neither did Kurt Cobain.  “@dirtylonghair: r u for/against grunge?
@TripleHeartbeat Well, for 1 thing, those are post-grunge's biggest bands. For another, they seem to be representative of the genre.
Perfect music for jocks & frat boys “@damienk:  Shlocky, ham-fisted pop "product" masquerading as some form of Rock music...”
Played on fest & hung with them. Good band, good guys. “@_BadBen_: Are you familiar with "Volbeat"?
No, that's the whole point. It already sounds like Muzak “@nedprevechevitz:  In a musak version, I would guess.”
Commercial glam had gotten out of hand. But post grunge is worse.  “@MrDrCaplan: grunge movement put an end to the commercial glam...”
@MrDrCaplan that's true. However one feels about orig. grunge, at least it was raw & live sounding.
"Jive Talking" especially!  “@Vortmax29:,- u say it like it is -  "Piano Man", "Jive Talking", "Rich Girl" over any crap Nickelback song.”
Its gotten unbearable. I can't imagine growing up w it “@DaveJProject:  radio rock is terrible.....keep on preachin' the truth dude!”
I wish they'd sing over natural trax   @PaperShredderRG “What do u think of singers (e.g. Katy Perry) who technically CAN sing well but...
And for the record, Kenny G is one of the nicest people I've met. I've given lessons 2 his son, a very good metal guitarist.
Overwhelming responses to my rant yesterday on that H-Stank song, "The Reason." Nearly universal agreement that it sucks.
Heck, I'd even listen to this guy over Hoobastank & Nickelback http://t.co/ddgCA1DC
...so called 'post grunge' ballads, most of which are over-processed, lifeless and tailor-made for Chili's & 24 Hr Fitness
Give me Billy Joel. The Bee Gees. Hall & Oats. At least it's honest easy listening. The Eagles. Earth Wind & Fire. Anything other than that
Not to rehash the 'Nickelback Rant.' But I will take anything, ANYTHING, over generic cookie-cutter 'light rock' posturing as hard music.
See my tweets from a few months back  “@kimoi_proth: that....or anything by Nickleback.”
'The Reason' by Hoobastank. If there is a Hell - and not in a cool, 'Slayer' kind of way-  they play music like this.
In the supermarket, the song overhead is so painfully bad, its nausea inducing. Mechanical, autotuned, elevator rock...
The moral of the story is: read everything carefully, critically & with a proverbial grain of salt - especially on April 1st!
This is why so many in the US are easily taken advantage of by advertisers, social media, political groups, banks & others.
Stories like that & 'Santorum's War On Metal' have attention-getting headlines w satirical text that is obviously fictitious.
Had it not been April Fool's Day, that story might have resulted in a widespread rumor requiring a statement of refute from the band.
The fact that anyone thought the 'Metallica Quits' story was real, even for a moment, confirms how easy it is to fool people.
"Wah is pure expression, much like Lou Reed’s voice. Everything on the album-percussion, vocals, guitars, bass - will go thru a wah pedal."
I'm especially looking 4ward to Kirk's upcoming concept album w Lou Reed, that explores the dynamic range of the 'wah' pedal.
