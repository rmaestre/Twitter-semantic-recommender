@nikolashatz you too my friend!
@GuitarEMH You mean the HM in disguise? That guitar has always played great but it currently needs a major fret job. But to answer you "yes"
@wooliegeek The pic was taken from the distributor's office I believe.
@colgtrs both good questions. I'm not 100% sure when it will be out but I'm guessing early next year. What to call it? hmmm, I'll work on it
@Rerellison haha... I agree, which is why the blue option is in addition to the orange as opposed to 'instead' of it.
@imaginaryroots  "Nooooooo, the orange was really nice"! -- The orange will still be available but now there will be some color options :)
@DEL_P_O Thank you... currently no plans for touring in Ireland but I hope that changes. I've always wanted to go there.
@nikolashatz It's currently an 'air norton s' in the the neck.. sounds great but I've spent much more time working on the bridge pickup
@ryansaranich I believe they'll be available shortly after we establish that it's definitely the signature design... likely early next year
@AdamLos75 lol.. "Walkie Talkie"... I'll go play it and let you know :)
@emerya68 Thank you sir!
@jonnypyr8 Yes, but not definitive at this point... we're actually hoping to do some shows there when I do come
@clintusmaximus Much appreciated! Rock on my friend :)
@clintusmaximus Very smart. That's why I've tried to emphasize that the current LE924 is not a sig model.. just a direction towards it.
Full view. Slightly thinner neck shape... not really thinner but a little less shoulder - fast! plus GH-6 pickup http://twitpic.com/2e47gq
Honing in on signature model with trans blue and real Floyd. "Orange" you glad we've got some different colors? http://twitpic.com/2e44uv
@TheScroounch So true!  Incidentally, that's --&gt; (tékiiila) the highest number of consecutive 'i's I've ever seen in a word. Do you agreeee?
@Emiliocarro No, I haven't checked out Fuzz Universe yet but I definitely will now - I'm hoping to have mine completed this year.
@ConradMalave That's is a good song title idea. You'll be thanked if I use it :)
@guitarnoize lol, why thank you sir :)
@KevinRosko  You know what? I like it! :-D
ADAD has just kicked in - all day airport delirium
Just overheard a guy use the phrase  "Bird's eye view" in a sentence, and for a split second I forgot that I didn't invent that.
@BrandonBrinson currently stuck in an airport after 2nd delay, but "yes" really enjoying the monthly 'write' :)
@BrandonBrinson Marshall Mathers!!
@Jonreshard uuuuuuhhh yea so I just wanted to let you know I got that lick together.. I mean I had it before but I'm just sayin'
anymore
After gig hang with Brian Murray, Dave Martone and all the guys from Guitar workshop plus, making sure not to drink tequila
@MonteroduniJazz BTW, Thank you so much! I had such an amazing time there!
@GuitarEMH Thank you... yes I got here safely but unfortunately my pedal board didn't make it.
@MonteroduniJazz Lol, Yea, I wish it was my home... it was truly incredible! I'll have to upload that pic at some point :)
Back at the house  for 7 hours, now off to Vancouver. I avoided the word home due to steadily increasing familiarity with window seats.
