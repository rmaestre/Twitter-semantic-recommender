Excellent resource for django's class based views. “@ptone: @gsiegman http://t.co/MQD77oQx cc @meshy”
@ptone @meshy Oh wow. That's extremely helpful. Thanks!
@pydanny Please retweet the Step 4 tweet too, so I don't seem like a complete ass. :-D
@palendae @theomn Yeah, I'm a complete raging asshole on Orkut!
@digitaljhelms Great advice.
@theomn Oh, I have plenty of it. I just try and save it for that "other" social network.
I really need to learn to stop tweeting at the exact moment I'm frustrated with something, and think first.
@theomn Yeah, it is the docs. I really shouldn't be complaining at all though. I haven't contributed a damn thing.
Step 4: Realize that I should stop complaining or contribute. :-)
Step 1: Make an attempt to use a Django generic CBV, Step 2: Browse to docs, look for what I need. Step 3: Give up and write a simple method

@joshourisman I think you're looking for Gotye. Goatse sings a whole different tune. :D
That's it. I'm calling tomorrow to get rid of cable TV. Always forget to DVR anything I'd want to watch anyway &amp; end up buying it on iTunes.
I have like 5 years developing with Django and I still can never remember PositiveSmallIntegerField without looking it up.
@joshourisman Klout says you're influential about Coffee, Django, and Bars. I've never seen it get it so right. :)
Remember when everyone thought Mark Zuckerberg was stupid for not selling to Yahoo for $1 billion?
@skevy @joshourisman I think you guys should just get a company limo and driver.
@joshourisman Awesome. Congrats! Do you plan on driving or taking MARC?
@joshourisman Commuting? Why?
@nickhudkins Agreed. I think it's finally given me the desire to actually buckle down &amp; learn CSS aside from just tweaking it occasionally.
@bkmontgomery This is my first time actually using Photoshop aside from those few times I opened it, said WTF? and closed it again.
@nickhudkins Thank you for that tutorial link earlier. It helped me a ton.
Just cropped my first 24 bit PNG in Photoshop. I am now a man.
It's funny that Photoshop still defaults to 56.6 Kbps when showing how long an image download will take.
@nickhudkins Awesome, thanks.
@jlecker Yes it does! :)
@richleland @joshourisman It's cool. Just trying not to keep you from your work while I learn things I need to know anyhow :-)
Also, the PSD isn't divided up into nice, perfect square &amp; rectangle images. That's the assumption that most resources I've found make.
What is the best resource for someone (me) who has never used Photoshop to learn how to cut up a PSD into HTML/CSS?
Attempting to cut a PSD for my very first time. I have no idea how to use Photoshop at all. Here goes nothing...
@joshourisman Yep. If that's the game they want to play, I can do it too. :-)
@joshourisman I'm laughing so hard at my Facebook post right now. Something as innocuous as "I love math" manages to start a debate.

Just watched the new NOVA episode Secrets of the Sun. Great episode, but now I'm afraid of Ra.
@gabegundy So were table-based layouts. :)
@theomn Yeah, that's definitely an improvement. I'm probably too much of a purist when it comes to this stuff. I just like clean markup.
@theomn Oh nice, I didn't even realize that existed. I'm a complete n00b when it comes to anything with CSS &amp; its relatives.
In fact, I think I'd rather see that stuff in an inline style than shoved into class.
I'm not an expert at front-end stuff, but I don't think there should ever be a class of "pull-right" or "pretty print" or "horizontal".
Twitter Bootstrap completely destroys separation of markup &amp; styling. Why stop using the style attr if we're going to shove it in class?
Except, WTF is this? http://t.co/Fze3pWZS Am I getting JSON back or an ASPX file?
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Bing's API is done much better than any of Google's.
If I could go back and start the parenting thing over again, I'd wait until I could afford to hire a full-time nanny. #parentalexhaustion

Alright Internet, what's the best way to convert a key/value-like XML file (no attributes) file to JSON with Python?
Fuck XML.

@joshourisman Cool. Honestly wasn't sure. I've been wanting to check it out myself, just had the impression that it was meant to run on GAE.
@joshourisman Sorry, let me rephrase. Is it useful outside of GAE? :)

The @github graphs are a trick from some evil overlord to get us devs writing more code. We'll do it too, just so our graphs look cooler.

@kcunning You just described my whole career in one tweet.
Humanity has become obsessed with branding.
@ptone Lately I'm unable to tell the difference between geeks & hipsters. I'm starting to see a lot of signs of Apple hate recently too.
That goes for music, movies, software companies, hardware companies, web apps, etc.
Apparently, it seems that the best way to stay in good favor with geeks is to never become too successful.
Twitter's Bootstrap documentation is missing really key points on a lot of their stuff. I find myself having to view source a lot.
@theomn Well I think I'm going to keep doing it then. It makes me feel special and unique.
Am I the only one who explicitly inherits from object for class Meta in Django?

It may be impossible to post or retweet something on Twitter without starting a debate.
"Contact us for a demo" actually means "our product sucks, but we're going to try &amp; convince people who don't know better, that it doesn't."

@magurski So yeah, I absolutely agree with you. Replacing system Python with a hand built version would be a horrible idea. :)
@magurski Ah, ok. Well if it ever comes in helpful here's a link explaining what virtualenv does. http://t.co/xBlgnwM9
@magurski Any decent Python developer should be aware of Virtualenv and never use or touch system Python.
@magurski No, I'm saying if they need a custom version of python, you can isolate their python environment completely from the system.
@joshourisman Say hi for me and give them my praises!
@magurski virtualenv :)
The smartest move for Dropbox to make today would be to double the storage space for all existing paid users.
Has anyone actually used SkyDrive for any length of time? Worth looking into?
Looks like Microsoft is winning in $ and specs. RT @jdriscoll: A good run down of online file storage pricing: http://t.co/MlEbfCm9
@jdriscoll Oh wait, that's per year though.
@jdriscoll It looks like SkyDrive only gives 7GB for free. $10 for 20GB. That's more than Dropbox or GDrive. $25 for 50GB, $50 for 100GB.
@jdriscoll Interesting. I wasn't aware of that. Haven't heard much about Microsoft's offerings lately, I'll have to check it out.
@jdriscoll Personally, I'd rather see Apple create this type of online storage as well and bake it right in to all their OS.
@jdriscoll ...on my hard drive, and it all syncs up just like Dropbox, paying double $ for the same service would be stupid.
@jdriscoll Right. I don't disagree. I've been highly critical of Google's failures. But if they give me online storage from a folder...
@jdriscoll Have they suggested that they'll be showing ads on paid GDrive accounts? I'm not seeing that.
@jdriscoll You're right, but what is leading you to believe that Google is evil enough not to get your money? Ads?
@jdriscoll Their business model is to make money. I support that.
@jdriscoll I pay $10/month for 50GB of storage, and I'm using 31GB so far.
@jdriscoll I'm not one of those people that subscribe to small underdog = virtuous, and big giant company = evil.
@jdriscoll Well I'm obviously not going to switch if the service is inferior and doesn't serve my needs. All things being equal....
@jdriscoll So, like I said, if they make a move to lower prices, yay competition!, and I'll stick around
@jdriscoll I love Dropbox as well. I've been a paying customer for 2+ years now, but double the price for 1/2 the storage is silly to me.
@jdriscoll No just encrypt the files you'd be worried about being indexed. Also, dropbox indexes your files as well, to avoid storing dupes.
@jdriscoll Isn't that what encryption is for?
Now, if @dropbox were to lower their prices significantly, it'd be tough to justify moving to Google Drive.
$5 a month for 100GB of storage from Google? I'm paying $10 a month now for @dropbox. It's going to be tough to justify staying with them.

@jeremybowers A good API will make things discoverable just like on a web page. Provide actual links to related resources, etc.

@jeremybowers They talk about it quite a bit in the O'Reilly RESTful Web Services book.
@jeremybowers I think there was a specification for RESTful web services called WADL that aimed to be the equivalent. Never seen it used.
