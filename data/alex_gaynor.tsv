@peterhajas God they love highlighting stuff with red text.
@jackdied @bitprophet I'm in neither camp.  You need both.
Mmmm.  That really was the best BBQ I've ever had.  Kudos to @fwiles and @jacobburch.
@diana_clarke So, for the record a friend of mine totally independent (and possibly first) invented that song when we were in the 8th grade.
@kitchenettekat my assumption was that it crossed over from syn-ack, you'd need a nerdy linguist to be sure /cc @jtauber ;)
@kitchenettekat in syn-ack it's still short for acknowledged
@kitchenettekat I always considered ack to be more nerdy than corporate. (See syn-ack)
@flangy who needs unsigned ints when signed overflow us defined.  #trollolololol
Microbenchmarks matter, if for no other reason than so that people will stick around to run real benchmarks.
@dabeaz They probably could, in Ruby they are unified.
I got @crateio translated to 15% in Hebrew, you should contribute to translating it in your language! https://t.co/D5COgGL6
@wesmckinn Modulo with negatives should just be undefined.  Makes my fucking head hurt.
@peterhajas And city.
@sontek That's fine, I disagree, but whatever.  But that's different from "its more bytes!!!!"
@jterrace That would be a really great point if we weren't already running our javascript through a dozen minimizers that can do it for us:)
@btriley 20-fucking-12.  Yeah.
If your first argument in favor of tabs is size (in bytes), you're wasting my time. Actually if any of your arguments are bytes it's a waste
@alonhorev Knowledge is power!
@garybernhardt Yes, and it only covers 1.8.7, not particularly useful.
I hear a lot of complains about Google's UI/UX.  Never once have I heard anyone say it was hard to use.
@holdenweb Most places ban drunk driving, which while dangerous, isn't hurting anyone.  Let's just ban reckless driving.
@holdenweb @mitsuhiko That makes it significantly harder to enforce, and means you have to wait for something to be a problem before you act
@wizputer 1
3600 lines of Python, and not a single except statement.
@kitchenettekat If you told them you'd fallen off a fence they'd be asking questions.  Like why you were climbing a fence?
PyPy used to have a thing called the timeshifter.  Now we have a blackhole.
@garybernhardt whatever, just so it's an error
@garybernhardt ruby scoping is interesting, I pity the implementors
@zzzeek Well, the Python JSON lib chooses to return integers, but the spec doesn't have them, AFAIK
@zzzeek No it does not, because Javascript doesn't have integers.  Everything is a float.  Enjoy.
99% of the uses of the word intuitive could be replaced with familiar.
Hmm, I think if you override Array#+ you could do hilarious things with multiple argument splats.
@garybernhardt Do you intend to try to push any of this stuff upstream?
@garybernhardt @ericflo Imply that Python was a Dutch attempt to rip off Sun's Java.  Ignore any and all chronological challenges.
@ericflo @garybernhardt GIL is easy mode.  Hard core troll is to insult dynamic languages as a whole.
Oooo, that feeling of complete confusion at someone else's engineer decisions.  It's been like a week since I've felt you.  I missed you!
That project estimate was one for myself on a personal side project.  No client is getting billed out of it.
Just estimated 17 hours for a project.  $20 says it's going to take &gt;40 hours.
@flangy When in Ruby, extend every instance of a class with the same method.
@idangazit I apologize in advance for the god awful grawings I'm going to send you.
@garybernhardt I opened the file in my editor before I saw it.
@kcunning kickstarter!
New hobby: watching the counters go up on https://t.co/zFrQEGoc .  I should get a life.
Loving https://t.co/OROFXGqj mostly because it shows I have the second best removed/added ratio :)
@jacobburch I apologize, but http://t.co/5ltjSAUn is hilarious
@jacobburch Yeah, please kick Orlando's ass so you can kick miami's ass.  kthnx
@hmason because long island
@jacobburch don't count us out....  But fuck
I think the JIT is trolling me right now.
O(n) sorting.  Buckets ftw.
Oh, this is what it feels like when you get to the boring part.
@brettsky We started at 2000x slower actually :)
@mdznr @peterhajas @jeffhui Unfortunately I'll be right in the middle of an interview while it's happening.
Survey on open source contribution, only takes a moment to fill out:  http://t.co/aBR0DcBX
@peterhajas @jeffhui Sorry I'm going to miss it :(  Will there be a video this time?
The point of statistics is that the result is as valid as the methodology.  Conclusion: never argue results, always methodologies.
OH: " cool, just got $45mln from the bank of china; nice"
@dabeaz @pumpichank RPython doesn't support list(string). :/  We should fix that, the list compr looks stupid.
@voidspace @pumpichank iter(dict) will suffice :)
I heard @toastdriven had accepted a $600 million contract from New York City.
@gthank @pumpichank iter(dict) is equal to dict.iterkeys(); that is `for k in dict:` will suffice
@pumpichank Why do people use iterkeys() ever ;)
@dabeaz @kneath @jackdied summarized this well, "i hate code and want as little of it un my product as possible"
@zeeg @jespern plan is Thirsty Bear Friday at 6:45 I think, /cc @ericflo
@kitchenettekat thanks
@kitchenettekat yup ill be up in the city the whole time, I'm here interviewing
@kitchenettekat not long, just through Saturday morning
San Francisco, I am in you.
This plane has 300 people on it, how the fuck do your computers not know about it?
United's computers don't know about our airplane.  Oh joy.
@derekwillis I'm in the airport for an hour and a half.  Does that count?
Dulles has 5 guys.  #winning
@garybernhardt put a special bit in all files for each user
@dabeaz @holdenweb You can introspect if you want, that's crazy ugly though.
The TSA should compensate me for my toothpaste and soap.
@fxdgear You're not stupid, in fact, you're likely very intelligent.
@holdenweb It was meant entirely in jest.
@Obdurodon @jessenoller FYI people who don't write compilers for fun all suck at programming.
Also, it you really don't care, I highly recommend actually ignoring it.
Guys, let's all talk condescendingly about the thing we're bad at.
@jessenoller I think my favorite part was the Google vs. Heroku one.
@richardhenry You can be on Quora though.  Works very well IME :)
"The comment in no way represents the culture that we're trying to build."  Except the fact that we said it of course.  Please ignore that.
@flangy .cpp and .h
@holdenweb @jacobian 'He wasn't where we wanted to be, but he wasn't our enemy'
@holdenweb @jacobian I heard some Vietnam era progressive activists on the radio what they said about kennedy has hung with me: [cont]
@jacobian Not that it applies to you, but I've found facebook and apple fans to be incredibly anti-google, and vocal about it.
@holdenweb @jacobian Their competitors turned up the mud slinging very effectively.
@montylounge There aren't for most sports :( ESPN has one, but you have to be a preffered partner to get stuff.
Just tried to read @Dropbox's terms of service.  I prefer legalese to this type of prose by a factor of 1000.  Legalese is more like code.
Facebook takes "Move fast and break things" too literally.  The unlike button is literally broken.
@garybernhardt Ah, you're talking about redis and the like?
@garybernhardt They don't require you to, you can implement the network protocol yourself; most people would rather use a preexitsing lib :)
I guess I should mention that it also uses 50% less RAM.
@zedshaw Will be fixed for python 3.3 I believe /cc @briancurtain
w00t, my optimization works: http://t.co/Dw90UFoB is 2x faster on my branch vs. pypy trunk!  w/ more room for improvement of course
Protip: don't pipe VIM to less.  It doesn't do what you want.
OH: "write [it] in PHP" "fuck you"
Open source should run bake sales to raise money.  I would totally bake shit to sell for Django/PSF/PyPy.
I think @fijall just learned a valuable lesson about unrolling 20k iterations of a loop.
@mihasya Real Chicago sports fans don't watch hockey.
@glyph Well probably, but no, this was just GCC being full of flail.
@oh_rodr Yeah I found the issue, just amused at the uselessness of GCC.
Sooo.... how is this line causing a segfault again? http://t.co/1rHSkxCT
@justinlilly 15.4 in laptop?
The Troy Record is a case study in how not to make a website.  Less than 20% of the above-the-fold space on an article is you know, article
@garybernhardt Elizabeth.
The answer was Acadians.
What is the name of the ethnic group that moved from Montreal to New Orleans, it's close to "acacia" or something.
@garybernhardt Arrays have a #last method, but no #penultimate.  That's bullshit.
@holdenweb Saying @mitsuhiko is competent is like Einstein was clever.
@garybernhardt @headius failing half the tests doesn't sound like it works to me
Because APIs are generated purely mechanically and have no creativity, httplib and requests are the same.
@brian_curtin Open Source comes to campus with @openhatchery
At today's event people generated patches for: Firefox, Django, ITK, and others!
OH: "image = Image.open(r'C:\femur.jpg')"
Just committed the first patch I ever wrote for Django, while teaching people about contributing to open source!  Thanks @brosner.
" 2 files changed, 68 insertions(+), 755 deletions(-)"  This didn't remove any features.  Nice work.
@mitsuhiko how often do you use a hash table as a key?
@mitsuhiko err, what are emit/parse here?
@mitsuhiko Just iterate in arbitrary order, like a Python dict
@mitsuhiko There are tons of algorithms where it isn't important; don't make those users pay the cost.
@mitsuhiko Ugh, provide a way to do it, not by default though, wasteful of memory/perf if you don't need it.
Bot going to lie, I'm pretty shocked by the devs who don't think APIs are copyrightable.
Day 1 of teaching people OSS: success I think.
@ncoghlan_dev https://t.co/0RHTFRU1
My slides on communicating in open source: http://t.co/U6Pkw2eF
Time for a day of teaching people about getting involved with open source w/ @openhatchery!
I definitely have a slide titled Read The Friendly Manual
@bitprophet some dude named tim wrote a fucking good sort algorithm for Python; java copied it.
@bitprophet http://t.co/gbDJew5k
Watching Google and Oracle fight about who wrote Timsort is cute.  Also, please don't sue PyPy for implementing Timsort, kthnx.
@tkaemming Yes, the bytecode that's generated is deterministic.
@tkaemming Try method calls for an example that's different.  On trunk, try a list comprehension.
@mtigas @tkaemming @kennethreitz PyPy's bytecode is very similar to CPython's, it is in no way guarnteed to be the same.
I love @ieure.
Anyone happen to have a pure-C parser for Ruby that has a sane API?
@jacobian Related idea https://t.co/Ay2yr6Ye works by dragging text documents onto the site.
Idle observation: people who write unreadable code tend to write unreadable slides as well.
@rtomayko What about the intensity of fucks.  Surely number isn't everything.
ISTM Oracle's claim is that it's possible to release code under a different license than the API.  Do projects need to state an API license?
Oracle put the copyright clause in their slides.... really?  Please tell me this is one of those "you had to be there" situations?
"the JIT compiler was generated" will never stop being an awesome message.
@peterhajas I haven't figured out what hte joke was, so I feel like a moron too :
@peterhajas What's the difference between a wrench and Bruce Willis?
@jtauber It's Palo Alto, some TV or another is getting background footage for a facebook/instagram/bubble/google segment every day.
@dabeaz Oh.  No longer surprised or interested, sorry :)
@dabeaz So a TV crew broke into your lair?
@dabeaz Why?
@brian_curtin Was instagram more or less than 2700 LOC?
My 12 day old project is worth $76k according to sloccount.  Any buyers?
The Soviet Union collapsed because of fax machines and Bruce Springsteen.  Discuss.
I was mostly talking about the arithmetic error, but those who have noted that there's a missing 0 are of course also correct :)
Biologists do math well.  See if you can spot the error! http://t.co/mOUr8RSr
@jterrace Unclear if there'll be a curve yet.
@jterrace Max was 11/14.  No one got an A.  Or a B for that matter.
@dabeaz grr :)
@jterrace Not in a long time, but I don't think the difficulty of the task has a bearing on the absolute quality of the result :)
@dabeaz Any API changes?
@wycats The CSRF protection is enabled by default (and has been for a few releases).
@ptone happy birthday!
@tnm It doesn't subclass RegularHorse or anythign?
@jacobian @pythonchelle @ubernostrum Damn right, everyone who's participated in this discussion is an exception.
@rhy0lite Being one to prefer a structural explanation to all things, I claim the mechanism of evaluation was broken, not the instance.
Out of 14 multiple choice questions on an exam (1 pt each).  With 51 students, the media was 4.0, mean was 3.6, and the max was 11. wtf?
I remember the first day @bfirsh and @andrewgodwin worked on @epiohq, I spent the day asking them: Can I tell it to deploy with my voice yet
@jacobian @pythonchelle For life of me I can't remember why I'm getting a CS degree.
Few things make me rage more than Javascript's failure to distinguish a hash table and an object.
@youngproductz @rguillebert @mikepavone @headius Yes, the GCs are written in RPython.
@mitechie need to be able to select ranges, don't think I ahve very special needs WRT percision
What's the best implementation of something like: http://t.co/4bVlfh8B
@jacobian how the fuck does that fit inside of the mare...
@jacobian a) weird, b) that looks fucking huge, can we get a shot with scale?
@jacobian waaaa, is that what baby horses look like?
@brian_curtin Py_XDECREF
@dabeaz I'd love a career writing compilers, just not parsers ;)
@dabeaz If you havent, you should, everything is so glorious by comparison (Says the guy who can't get unary ops or attr assignment to work)
@dabeaz OTOH, +1, OTOH: why would you possibly volunteer to wade back into parsers!
@mikepavone @headius @rguillebert The GCs are mostly written in RPython, not C.
@headius I think there are a lot of static language compilers that quality then.
@headius gcc?  What do you mean by self-hosted impls?
@jtauber yeah I do, they seemed like gimmicks then and they do now too
@jtauber @kennethreitz was it useful then?
@peterhajas Also Javascript!
@gthank things like colors and weights to various data.  I want to just let JS compute it from data,but JS is le-slow.
Annoying: browser is slow; do I precompute rendering info on the server?  It feels so wrong...
@fwiles loops also cause me to switch.  really anything besides a linear sequence of commands
http://t.co/VTCYLMZ6 is sporting the RPI colors today.  Neato.
@joestump Well now I'm just hungry.
@dabeaz No (though I am writing one ATM), just trying to tweet an interesting project to work on every week, last week was write an RDBMS.
This Monday's coding project: build a VM: writer a parser, AST, compiler, interpreter, and object model. Create a language or impl an old 1!
