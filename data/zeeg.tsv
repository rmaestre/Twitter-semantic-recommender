@kneath had that same problem today. MAKES NO SENSE

@jamessocol is it kind of like a 404 request? or is this unrelated to HTTP? I only skimmed the page
@jamessocol would this just be a new log record, or would it be its own kind of event/interface?
@jamessocol not really familiar with CSP, but I'm not against some kind of extension to handle it
Anyone want to guinea pig a Rails 3 client for Sentry?
@rdegges why specifically a book on Heroku? Id say EC2 is just as (if not more) common for deploying, and deploying to Heroku is easy

@bleikamp flex that social profile. About the same reason you'd put anything I suspect
@mwhooker wonder if big query can handle your mom
@andymccurdy Adding some better support for Celery in Raven: https://t.co/Eq3MwVSR
@bkonkle also something else that was brought to my attention: https://t.co/rXUsXhCD
@voidspace The docs are more or less terrible. Look at https://t.co/GMvzzKd1 and put that in proj.app.gargoyle
@bretthoerner What time? I have a redeye so I could grab a drink if you're not here too late
@bretthoerner heading home (going to BigOmaha) for a week, as of Friday night
@bretthoerner @thedz I'm jelly but I'll be living it up on franchise food next week
@flashingpumpkin client side. I'd never choose this if I had another choice :)
@bkonkle Also if you get time, would love to get your feedback on the origin implementation/changes: https://t.co/EtmieayX

Learning how to write JavaScript tests. Remembering why I write Python.
@bkonkle going to implement a bunch of new things for raven-js. Should have a pull request for you sometime this week
Is there a good 15-minute guide on how CORS works?
@andymccurdy but you can't actually raise that right?

@kantrn +1 go write that shit @thedz :)
A bunch of @FAKEGRIMLOCK posters just arrived at the office
@thedz I think @kantrn almost has a working Ruby client
@aknin actually it shouldn't be that bad. The main feed should still be really fast
@aknin in theory it will be ok -- it at least won't explicitly not allow it. It could slow down some of your feeds though

@thedz @bretthoerner +1 shut up nextbeard
@jaysonsantos Honestly I don't remember. But you won't be able to get composite primary keys working in a way you want
@jaysonsantos you should just give up on composite pks. Set the model to unmanaged and pretend they're composite indexes or drop the pks
@jaysonsantos it hasn't been touched in years, and likely doesn't work at all
@noahkagan @ckj going to be in the city at all?
@noahkagan Don't burn it down too quickly?
@mwhooker weak
@alex_gaynor we bingecon'ing? /cc @jespern
@mwhooker you still downtown?
@SachaGreif @grokcode what about Sentry vs Airbrake ;)
@Vitabee4ever When are you making those?
Newest hack in our pre-commit hooks: http://t.co/Lm2sUZOl (ensure you are testing against listed requirements)
@dstufft @mitsuhiko no :/
@mitsuhiko is that.. a bug?
@ncoghlan_dev @mitsuhiko Sentry is attractive :D
@jorilallo Ya when I had mine I couldn't make any use out of it. Sold it less than 2 weeks after I got it
@jorilallo Ya at that point you get much more bang for the buck. Once you start attaching things to the iPad it loses its value: mobility
@jorilallo I feel like at this point you should just buy a Macbook :)
Removing the last trace of *mongo* from the disqus-web repo
@NorthIsUp ~20s in my test :)
Adding magical only-create-the-db-if-you-cant-migrate behavior to the Disqus test suite
I love that our customer support team knows how to use Sentry
@jezdez @freakboy3742 it's almost as bad. I never found anyone to take it over so I've only pulled in very basic change sets
@mitchellh @pharkmillups that's what we tried. That just doesn't seem scalable for something like Airbrake
@pharkmillups would be curious how people make scalable lists in Riak
@holman awesome gonna try out the updated play.coffee tomorrow
@holman how do you guys configure the user's githubLogin? I added a comment so that users type "hubot my github is &lt;x&gt;"
OH: @matmullen is the training wheels of DISQUS [foosball]

@paltman This is helping us move towards a smart test suite which will only bootstrap the db if migrations don't match
@paltman Just sent another pull req up for nashvegas. This should be the start to something great :)
The new GitHub graphs are sexy: https://t.co/MnamBMxy
@jezdez But this is specifically using setuptools, so it's not really a big deal. (I don't do distutils fallbacks0
Couldn't take the default Octopress theme anymore, switched to "slash" instead: http://t.co/Y8HlX40I
@mjtamlyn does your site not contain a setup.py?
@mjtamlyn why? what benefit does that serve?

@kennethreitz side effect of them having no content
@monokrome ya probably doesn't support Django 1.4
@monokrome anything in console?
@tanukifurry ya got everything else working now :)
@tanukifurry Ya. Unfortunately it doesn't work. I rewrote a bunch of it so it works bare-bones
@tanukifurry @tekkub you guys happen to have an updated play.coffee that works? :)
@tanukifurry @tekkub Ya I'm launching with bin/hubot -a irc (is there a better way to launch? we're just going to run it locally on a mac)
@tekkub @tanukifurry ya all I did was set IRC name and he seems to ignore that
Hey GitHub guys, how do you change the command hubot responds to? (We want it to be his IRC nick)
@fijall generally once it happens to Joe, he cares :)
@kennethreitz Ya, it's an amazing album

Really like the Play OS X client. Just needs some better UX feedback (and a way to close it)
@adamstrawson and I sent one in. I'm not a Ruby developer. Don't preach to me how open source works.

Got Play working with a couple of tweaks: https://t.co/koMi0HcN
@mojombo if someone called out something I maintained, I'd try to address their problem. Not saying I'm in the right, but it worked
@mojombo I will happily +1 open source things, but that shouldn't mean low quality
@mojombo I sent up issues/pull requests, but it literally did not work at all out of the box
@xpaulbettsx I filed two or three already, and sent a pull request
@sumeet_agarwal :D
@bleikamp Looks like if you don't explicitly select things in iTunes it just breaks (might just need README updates)
@bleikamp As soon as I get it to work, learn Ruby, and care enough, I'll fix the thing so it actually runs :/
Trying out GitHub's Play application. This shit is broken in every single way I can possible find. Terrible

@corbett_inc I think somethings spamming your Twitter

@pavel_lishin need a license to rent one ;) I'm going to just get someone to rent one for me though and cheat the system
@pavel_lishin ya I've always either owned a car or had a friend I could borrow one from to take it
@kmactane yep, driving test
@bretthoerner I think my plan now is to hijack someones rental for it
@thedz I'm afraid to touch @gjcourt's car
@bleikamp well there IS a driving test :P
How does one get a license in SF without owning a car?
@CiprianRPhoto unfortunately I don't believe Facebook allows you I export data
@jb55 I've been wanting to try out Tera for a while. Hope it's good
@stechico oh well, a little bit different. For me it was meeting a bunch of them in person and losing all hope
@stechico the entire community that's part of Dribbble
@tekkub definitely
@stechico full of people who think too much of themselves
@tekkub mostly accurate
Tonight I learned how unfortunate Dribbble is
@sashagrief One of our designers here at DISQUS told me you might have some ideas
@mwhooker hate
@bretthoerner you should come too. We can eat Steak and have a party in a corn field
@kennethreitz please oh please let people respond with a Yes

@mojombo from the experience I've had with both, it gets a little bet in some areas, and worse in others (ES vs Solr). Still not great
@jcroft @zeldman font-size is a bit unbearable (too large, not enough margins between paragraphs) on my 15" MBP

Really cool hearing the Instagram infrastructure story (at SF PUG). It's almost identical to how Disqus evolved early on.
@kennethreitz @ielectric the JS guys tell me it shouldn't be Disqus related
@argv0 yo come help us make riak work. I'll feed you beer
