@julienphalip Be sure to checkout the fabric integration stuff in PyChef too, makes for a great orchestration helper!
@julienphalip Saying Salt is in Python is a bit of a stretch, your actual configs are in Yaml, not Python.
@julienphalip No, embrace the polyglot :-)
@pacopablo @alecthomas Steam include the native Mac port now.

PSA: document.write and document.writeln are off limits. Seriously. #jsrage
@fnichol If you can find me a better JS impl that goes from raw text to _safe_ markup, I can try swapping it out. There aren't many though.
@fnichol I don't think I can fix that easily as is :-/ Plan is to move back to a Ruby-based and GH-compat renderer eventually.
@fnichol What does it show now? I'm just using some JS markdown impl I found in 20 minutes that looked like it worked :)
@thedz Alternatively write the railtie to set it up and send me a pull req :)
@thedz No, the rack middleware should work fine, just inject it yourself http://t.co/SNWdBQi7
@thedz Do you need plain Ruby or Rails? raven-ruby works great for plain Ruby stuff, still working on the rail tie
@flangy Pioneer Square and until Friday
Off to Seattle. If anyone wants to meet up while I'm around, let me know!
@bryanwb Want to send me the main pain points? I can add them to my epic :)
@julienphalip Yep, the normal lucid boxes ship with Chef 0.10.2, old enough to break my recipes &gt;_&lt;
Using Vagrant and Chef? Add 'config.vm.provision :shell, :inline =&gt; "gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc chef"' to your file. #protip #opschef

@alecthomas Yeah, everyone there is apparently under strict orders to not talk about it, so I'm ignoring it :-)

@grabboxapp Any idea why grabbox will periodically just stop seeing new screenshots? Restarting the app doesn't help.
@miah_ Code has well-defined semantics and a single (or small number of) interpreter to test on. English is poorly defined at best.
@bkjones If you have questions, you know where to find me.
OH: "he looks like a norse god, i just look like a viking"
@lusis Stdout is a good _default_ logging dest, but you should really use the native configurable logger :)
@theSeanOC That reminds me I need to get around to adding the auto-environment tasks in.
@pumpichank Hint, git merge --no-ff solves much of complaints there.

@rgov Yeah, or http://t.co/r1A6cDq0 has the right address.
@rgov New York Pizza on Stevens Creek.
@mllerustad When the dev and designer are 2 states away and limited to Skype and text chat, its somewhat more appealing :)
@mllerustad Not so sure I agree, from the dev side an unrealistic mockup usually provides more insight into the goal than a "real" image.

@bshaurette +1, same reason I put up with Rails and Couch and the other crap we use, projects are awesome and the people are top-notch.
@bshaurette I just wish I had all the code for this app, first time I've worked with zendguard and it is driving me up a wall.
@bshaurette Also I spent quite of bit of this week writing PHP oddly enough.
@bshaurette Give it another week, I'm sure someone will. ::hugs::
@bshaurette I know your pain, /me glares at Rails.
@gemnasiumapp Doesn't mean it can't be improved to be opt-in instead (and to remove the hook when you disable a repo).
@daniellindsley Don't tempt me, I'm livid.
Because @gemnasiumapp decided to install service hooks on every one of my repos: https://t.co/8pVTsFuh #rage
@miah_ You know, a single-map, persistent world version of Outpost would probably make a pretty nifty HTML5 game. #notime
@miah_ How about MOO and/or Outpost (1 more so than 2)?
@miah_ as a former Hulk pilot, I beg to differ ;-)
@miah_ Eve ;-)
@freakboy3742 I went back to Mail.app, but I vastly prefer no badges. Herald will show me new mail every 30 minutes, it can wait.

@miah_ It is on the list to fix &gt;_&lt; never enough time.
@ashemedai that's from a codegen, someone on reddit recognized it.
@ashemedai I've always liked it, but I've always used MP3, not Vorbis.
@ashemedai I've heard the decoder in FMOD isn't great compared to other formats, and Everyone™ uses FMOD.
@dstanek Probably out of pre-created accounts, I only made 100 and I won't be refilling it. You can make your own Hosted Chef trial acct.

@vishcious The steps to make the EC2 server are both in the slides and the labs tab on the portal site.
@vishcious What part of them?
@bkjones Hover's DNS console allows it if nothing else :-)
@bkjones Only because some DNS servers don't allow you to put a CNAME on the apex domain. The problem (AFAIK) is with A records, not apex.
