#MusicMonday Bassist  Doug Rauch http://t.co/nF10LVlT
@nilerodgers Bernard Edwards was SUCH a great bassist! His playing Everybody Dance is insane- very reminiscent of the late great Doug Rauch.
@queenesther The punchline is someone clawing &amp; biting their way to buy a pair of those &amp; finding they don't fit. Hilarious.
@DIY_Musicians @MusicWeekNews Dylan certainly deserves it. It's easy to forget that there's a Zimmerman whose only weapon is his pen

@MarcoRLamas The sad CrAzY irony is that the biggest influence on Gangster Rap was the sound of Public Enemy whose message was it's opposite
@MarcoRLamas Intriguing read-The No Names tends to make me doubt it's veracity; cheap guns &amp; crack had the REAL impact. Rap was it's mirror

Speculation on my part. Let's see what the trial & a jury say.
A sad angry dude, who got caught up in being The Hero in the Action Movie in his mind-backed by normative racism, a horrendous law, & a gun.
So The Face Of Zimmerman is REVEALED to show- a dude. Not the Wild Eyed Militiiaman of my imagination-but dude who looks like dudes I know--
Zimmerman is in custody & it's CRUCIAL he get a FAIR trial. The Stand Your Ground law that produced this tragedy needs to be arrested too.

Your not gonna believe this, but I got Jolly VNC Pro to WORK-I can see the Mini desktop on my MBP AND the wireless kybd works NO CURSOR! WTF
@chadfowler Thank You for the tips, kind words-I'm actually about to focus on what I can get done. Best news is I can copy the films over!
@chadfowler Need the adapter to VGA that I don't have-HDMI cable's are pretty ubiquitous & the HDTV's port is accessible 1 trip to the lobby
@chadfowler Got AirDisplay-Just realized if can get an HDMI cable I can rig up the room's HD TV-If there's an IT Guy here, he's long gone...
@BajanTeecha True. Guitar & Sleep....But I'm MAD awake. I'm still on EST. Hard not to take advantage of that-For guitaring's sake alone!
The other prob is Snow Leopard Vs Lion MBP=Snow L Mini= Lion. I can get to the Mini's SP via the MBP, but it's incompatible.
MAdDeNing; the borrowed E-net cable WORKS-I can get to the mini's HD, but not to it's system without typing the security PW I can't see. Grr
So I got an Ethernet cable from the front desk (minor miracle this) If I can get screen sharing  going I'll be halfway there. Thanks All!
@philsherry Yup-This can happen via wired connect right?Or I gotta get the mini on the same wi.Have 2 films on the mini I gotta send cues to
Thinking Mini to MBP Ethernet-sys pref-turn wifi on the Mini, use VNC or  desktop app, once all 3 are on the same net-possible?
Calling All MacGeeKs! I dragged my Mini out here no monitor. Have MBP & iPad. What's the best way to get either device to act as monitor?
@robertglasper Your new record was the soundtrack to my flight to Europe. Congratulations! It KILLS! I.E; Erykah & you are SUBLIME together.

@KyleSuch We're cool. I enjoyed the exchange.
@KyleSuch It sure is now. If & when they feel like it.
@KyleSuch being pulled over & flashing lights can end up horrendously? I reject accepting this as a norm; just another "tool". It's NOT OK.
@KyleSuch the way we want our democracy conducted? With the fear that any minor interaction with law enforcement will be traumatizing? That
@KyleSuch arbitrary nature of it's application is in itself deeply troubling. The threat of it's use will be free speech stifling. Is this
@KyleSuch and freezing until she submitted to the search. Humiliation is somewhere in the spectrum of cruel and unusual-the completely
@KyleSuch searches & seizures, granting unlimited power to jailers without any oversight. When that nun refused to submit she was kept naked
@KyleSuch Don't patronize me, What you're refusing to recognize is how the ruling upends 4th amendment protections against unreasonable
@KyleSuch Thus "Enhanced Techniques" trickle down to us.The abject humiliation of citizens ACCUSED of minor offenses becomes routine. Banal.
@KyleSuch Alarmist, eh?They strip searched a nun, & a motorist for not using  a turn signal & that was BEFORE the Supreme Court said it's OK

The only thing missing is strip searches for  possession of contraception. Virginia Legislature... Get To Work!!!!!!!!!!!
If you wish to raise your voice, you will be made to pay the price. Your potential dehumanization is just a handcuff or twist-tie click away
to stifle dissent. If you think this isn't going to be used against the Occupy movement, think again. First them. Then you.
The recent Supreme Court decision to allow for humiliating strip searches for minor offenses makes no sense. Until you consider it as a tool
