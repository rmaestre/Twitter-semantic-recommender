Heres one for you guitar experts.One is 0-0137 1960 Les Paul and the other is Collectors Choice# 3. Which one is old? http://t.co/H6XYq4Cs

London UK...  Here to record some radio shows and interviews.  The last ten gigs of leg one start Friday..
@Lefsetz  heres a good deal artist should sign..  360 over zero deal..Meaning they should put the records out themselves.. Keep it all I say
@Lefsetz  what does a 540 deal actually mean?  does the clueless AandR guy actually grab your guitar and play for you as he robs you blind?
Do not disturb signs at hotels should read " Can we disturb you as many times as possible to confirm you do not want to be disturbed"

Landed in Stockholm..I was supposed to meet some peeps downstairs for dinner.  So shattered from the week Im calling Domino's..( not really)
Stockholm here we come...Only gonna take us 11 hours of van travel, luggage check in, and security lines to fly the two hour journey!!  Fun!
Sticking up for bands that spend everything they have on going there and have 0 people at their gig cause the "big name"plays a secret show.
maybe I just remember..  1995 when we did it with Bloodline.. It actually was for new acts.. Not majors who make 250k a night
I thought SXSW was supposed to be for undiscovered acts..  from the reports I heard..  It was like a softball Coachcella.. I call..  B%^Sh%t
The new russian hats are a hit even at the top! http://t.co/fW4z8Yep
