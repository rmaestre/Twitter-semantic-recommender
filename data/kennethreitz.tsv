@PhillyD what aperture do you shoot the PDS at? Do you use super bight lighting to compensate for a high f stop?
@stevelosh it definitely has its use cases, though: http://t.co/B23C3kJc
@stevelosh this is particularly true with internal code

@ethanschoonover that's amazing. Exact opposite of my desk. :)
@ajweinstein very much so, but it's only for maiming lists that exist on it. This would be for any existing ones.

Domain obtained: http://t.co/VSORJ7jB. Development will occur over here: https://t.co/CkPsLC2h … later :)
@textfiles *rolls eyes*, fine an RSS Reader :)
@kelseyprantis Ooh, it could have private RSS feeds. Great idea!
@johnsheehan agreed. Almost none of my lists are hosted there, though.
@tswicegood hmm, how would the karma/sorting work?
@EmilStenstrom yeah, but that only works for Google's mailing lists. I mean one for *any* list.
Hmm, I wonder how useful a Google Reader for mailing lists would be. Thoughts?
@darkuncle I think this all the time.
