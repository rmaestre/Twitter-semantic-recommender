Sounds like the official solution for having robust nodejs event loops polling from redis is not having callbacks raise exceptions.
@BenHop no, just incapable.
Aaaaand. Still looking for a place to stay in London/Bromley :-/
@mjackson worker using redis. callback from redis fails -&gt; server dies unless i also add an error handler to redis.
I'm too stupid for node I'm afraid. How do you write a robust main loop when every event handler might have falling callbacks?
Back in London! One day late due to my inability to organize shit. Yay.
@paniq also observe the hyperbole. I can think of tons of other stuff more evil than ea.
@paniq wanna bet that they licensed the music on time? The only thing more evil than ea is the music industry.
@markusgattol we should indeed do that :-)
@markusgattol nope, i moved to london. But I still have friends in Graz :-)
@markusgattol but I can't believe there was no better solution for the problem than banning alcohol :-/
@markusgattol the punks next to spar were obnoxious, i give them that. At one point they were inside the shop asking for change :-/
Boooo. Graz is introducing a no alcohol zone in the center of the city.  The damn punks ruined it for the rest of us :-/
@zh1nt0 you up for an AMA on reddit at /r/battlefield3 in the near future? I will ensure that we're keeping it civil :-)
Riot games ups the ante to 2 million dollars price money for LoL season finals this year. Shit is getting real.
@stevelosh i made a vagrant vm for this particular thing :-/
I'm impressed that folks from DICE stick around on sites like reddit despite all the horrible folks on there. Takes a lot of self control.
@garybernhardt @/regex-here/ :-)
Yay. Twitter just decided to mark every direct message since January as unread. :-/
@flowblok up
Holy crap is the tribes ascend updater bad. It just managed to fully crash a windows machine by causing massive io from the service.
Hey everybody. I will bring back the paste in in read only mode once I scanned and cleaned the records.
@Habbie until two weeks ago the whois record was not pointing to my name :P
And I thought @paniq was joking: http://t.co/WjJ5b4kL :D
@JurieOnGames i'm still contemplating on that. I will ask a lawyer before doing anything.
@paniq I don't have an xbox in the UK, I just watched @Arnout and @digibawb play it. Neither finished it without the interwebs though :)
@JurieOnGames the worst part was seeing how much traffic those offensive links created. I could vomit.
@paniq the QR codes are optional. There are puzzles if you don't have the QR code. For the alphabet there is a rosetta stone.
Audi buys and Instagram worth of Ducati: http://t.co/4qRZzxka (via @Arnout)
In related news: thank god sopa did not pass.
The pastebin dilemma: open to robots: spam, closed to robots: 
child pornography link dumps :-/
I added an update to http://t.co/riedO2IZ that explains a little bit why the service is down: http://t.co/XfM9E5P6
People were using the pastebin as a tool to distribute illegal content. (And by that I don't mean torrent links).
I've shut down http://t.co/riedO2IZ for now. Will try to bring it back in one form or another in the future.
Today is the day I regret ever having had the idea to run a pastebin.
@secretglyph launchd is a cool piece of tech, but not without fault. launchctl is damn annoying for a start.
@secretglyph cgroups, dbus, support for user input at different point in times (before gui, after gui) etc.
@secretglyph explain what part. the reasoning behind socket based activation?
@secretglyph i think that's what motivated upstart. systemd has a legitimate advantages over launchd.
@aaloy if things go really bad they don't have enough support personnel. (For instance power outage due to faulty equipment).
@Disasterpeace what are the odds of eventually seeing the FEZ soundtrack back on spotify?
We just noticed that OS X has different hinting for the menu bar and the right username dropdown menu. Now it will always bug me …
@bitprophet “there's something silly at the end” — you mean everything before the end is not silly?
Hetzner's datacenters do look impressive: http://t.co/RQzZtBQ5 — wish they would work on their support though.
TIL: blowtorch == flamethrower. same thing really.
Not only does the server right now die due to incredible high IO the moment Apache is up, it's also badly connected: http://t.co/2t83YKgC
Trying to get http://t.co/FavDoe2E back under control. Server is very unhappy today.
In light of recent news read this page about systemd and appreciate the design that went into it: http://t.co/FB0MfpVk
Actually. socket.fromfd exists. I think that should make it work with systemd.
Unfortunately systemd's socket based activation does not work for Python 2.x :-/
@zeeg @ncoghlan_dev and genuinely fun to use :-)

Python 2's ssl module is so damn useless. It hurts :-/
All those machines seem to have a fixed IP range, so if you make some http requests you can others play with it.
Those “try ubuntu server” on a cloud thing (that gives you an hour of cloud computing) is fun. Change last digit and see people exploring.
@Demize99 also, thank you for bringing the AUG back. Makes me very happy :-)
@JurieOnGames … new but did not solve all of the same problems (mostly that it worked on windows without problems).
@JurieOnGames overall it's unfortunately very grim because somewhere along the line someone replaced easy_install with a solution that was …
@JurieOnGames it used to be worse. virtualenv under windows works quite well if you use easy_install instead of pip.
@SupergiantGames great news that it comes for steam play as well. Still very unhappy with id for not releasing the rage for mac on steam.
@LuitvD &lt;3
Speaking of bad design: ubuntu unity is still ugly :-(
Context for the tweet about “Dear Python, Why Are you so ugly?”: http://t.co/Ay65o5kT
@hynek that's part of the reason why I think encouraging people to learn some sort of design is good.
But that post is incredible selective. There are a bunch of well designed Python library websites out there.
if the “Python Why are you so ugly” post would encourage people to invest some time into making websites beautiful, then I'm all for it.

@KarthikDot @stevelosh depends on what you have to do. I find HtmlUnit reliable enough and if it's without JS just parse html with html5lib.
I have to say, @casperjs_org is a darn cute project twitter account. Kudos!
@casperjs_org unfortunately you don't solve my problem because i need to test a rather complex javascript handshake with different browsers.
Watching selenium do its thing is a mesmerising process. If only it would be faster :-(
@pixelmager @geeks3d oh god yes! This makes me very happy :)
@thrmoptc noes!
Some context: Google managed to lose my reply, mailed me from two different departments who knew nothing of each other. All form letters.
Not surprised devs go with Facebook these days. Their hiring department seems a lot more competent and responsive than Google's.
Am I understanding that correctly that Python 3 CD only release of ubuntu 12.10 is not happening?
@pumpichank does the python executable still point to 2.7? Also, how does Python 3 and 2.7 coexist? (For server installations)
Aww. So cute seeing the internet freak out over terms of services again.
@Demize99 god bless the recent change page :-)
@CRYTEK_TIAGO that looks seriously impressive.
I think it's slowly getting to the point where I have to assume the Flask theme is public domain. Just spotted it on http://t.co/RRUaSVht
@kennethreitz http://t.co/vfYgyOVH is all you ever need.
@oberhamsi @JurieOnGames UI != battle log. The UI is written in Flash (scaleform), the website is Python/JavaScript and done by ESN/DICE.
@kennethreitz werkzeug.UserAgent :P
@gabegundy the .dmg contains a python interpreter and a bunch of bytecode.
Google Drive is using Python. As in CPython 2.6.
Neato. Opeths' cover of “Den Standiga Resan” from the Watershed Special Edition is on Spotify: http://t.co/XsDQsxGk
@ncoghlan_dev @holdenweb @raymondh … let's go shopping? :P
@garybernhardt some python guy did the same with "python -mordor" :-/
@mitchellh we're still working on making in less magical :-) But it's unfortunately a balancing act between magic and crappy API :-(
How the hell did I manage to get 4000 twitter followers and 1000 of those on github. That all feels so unreal. Thanks everybody.
Mindfuck. Armin Rigo wrote QuArK a map editor for Quake and others for which @paniq apparently made an icon set. O_o

I admit that I love multiple inheritance a whole lot, but this … this is going too far: http://t.co/jQY42DkB
@hpk42 i don't sell my open source stuff, so i don't really think about that. My POV is making open source and selling services based on it.
@hpk42 BSD/MIT work for me, I don't have to care about too much legalese and that makes me a happy man. Worry free :-)
@hpk42 i much prefer closed source libraries over gpl libraries because they have less restrictions in using them. You *can* license them.
@hpk42 i believe into trusting people to do the right thing and don't want to force people into some licensing scheme. Enter MIT/BSD

@juanplopes @argentinomota worth it. Other languages are doing just fine with it.
@alex_gaynor ?
@alex_gaynor dumps/loads json for instance.
@alex_gaynor the fact alone that emit_dict(parse_dict()) does not result in the same order is stupid for caching.
@alex_gaynor so how would you iterate over the hashmap otherwise?
@alex_gaynor consistent iteration behaviour is important, extra memory usage for keeping the insertion order in memory is negligible.
If you design a new language: make hash maps ordered by insertion time. Solves so many problems right from the get go.
The fact that diablo III's launcher is running with root rights is slightly concerning.
@brettsky @holdenweb yes, yes. I should.
I now have actively participated in the downfall of blackberry by "sneaking" into their devslovebacon party.
I just received proper Austrian Speck!
I probably should start learning iterating on text instead of throwing it away.
By now I have like five unpublished blog posts and three internal mails sitting around which I don't know if I want to publish/share.
@asolovyov it does that for me in firefox O_o
TIL: window in JavaScript behaves as if it was an Array. A weird one: http://t.co/oIH7J8aF

@kumar303 happens in multiple different firefox versions on different operating systems.
OH: Why is everybody ginger in the face?
@kuramanga seems to be related to this: https://t.co/urNFBEpD
@kuramanga POST to https which then redirects to another https resource. No file uploads, just one single field. Also cookies.
I have a mysterious case where a POST request from a http page to an https page that involves a redirect stalls Firefox. Reproducible. :-(
@stevelosh will give you a tweet or something tomorrow after work. We're still busy with website launch and everything :-)
Website launch went pretty smooth, now to python stuff :)
@RiFGamers it's a timed exclusive for iOS and no other platforms have been announced. As an Android user I hope as well :-)
@RiFGamers keep in mind there is an unannounced free to play pc title coming up later this year :-)
@roberts_brendan we have not announced any other platforms yet :-)
@RiFGamers why what part? The iOS part of the free to play part?
@bhagany yeah, I will be doing that at one point. Just making sure first it's bulletproof. :-)
If you're curious about what we're doing, @PaulWedgwood talks about the future of our companies on gamasutra: http://t.co/dWRQLZmy
Yay. PHP is crashing :-(
Interesting implementation fact: the login/account pages are behind HTTPS and the cookie never goes to HTTP. Uses frames for session sync.
What we're up to (Fireteam/Splash Damage/WarChest) currently: a free to play iOS game http://t.co/C3m3NspG \o/
@garybernhardt he is wrong on the tab thing though. Firefox has disabling of tabs in the options menu and it remembers it after upgrading.
Cross-domain session synchronisation makes me warm and fuzzy inside. I'm a weird person.
Yes you can execute things on fork in uwsgi: http://t.co/7PBHPo5P \o/
Does anyone know if you can execute code if uwsgi forks for the workers?
@krak3n there is no way to be compliant with the law. BT for instance uses cookies to implement the opt-in mechanism :P
I wonder when the first smart-ass starts using local storage to implement the cookie opt-in mechanism :P
@krak3n EU law no country but UK has adopted to the best of my knowledge.
God. The british cookie law makes me rage. So damn stupid.
The metro c++ overview is quite interesting. Unfortunate to see that OpenGL is out but it makes sense. http://t.co/mlCXGmsI
Why is it so hard for programmers to follow the simple rule "decode on input, encode on output". It's so simple to follow :-(
Ignore my question. $ matches *before* the newline, it does not include it.
Why does it behave this way?

@LuitvD if you want to speak to an ski server, how do you do it in python 2?
Meh. Python 2.x does not support SNI.
@fabiankochem_ep good point. i should!
That actually might be conspiracy on my part here. Looks like the album is still just up fro preordering. Probably released by accident.
@ardrigh @polytron i actually am part of the crowd that thinks rippping individual pieces out of an album is wrong :-)
I can kind of understanding pulling content from spotify to help album sales, but it still feels like the wrong thing to do (cc @Polytron)
